This means the chicken cooks more uniformly, reducing the time needed to reach the desired internal temperature. Stovetops, while effective, can have hot spots and uneven heating, leading to slower cooking.\n*   **Temperature Control:** Ovens allow for precise temperature control, enabling you to cook chicken at lower temperatures for a longer period, which is crucial for achieving a perfectly cooked product. Stovetops often have less precise temperature control.\n*   **Cooking Methods:** Ovens are better suited for methods like roasting, baking, and broiling, which require consistent heat and rapid temperature changes. Stovetops are more suitable for simpler methods like pan-frying.\n\nHowever, both stovetops and ovens can cook chicken effectively.
